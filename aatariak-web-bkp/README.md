# Aatariak core

## Description
- This module holds the library for the project
- Note that the Spring Boot plugin is not used in the library project at all
- The main function of the plugin is to create an executable “jar”
- Although the Spring Boot Maven plugin is not being used, you do want to take advantage of Spring Boot dependency management, so that is configured by using the spring-boot-starter-parent from Spring Boot as a parent project
